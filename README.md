html5-cv
=======

This is a *responsive* html5 version of my resum√©. It uses the [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/) icon font and was built using LESS. The background pattern is from [subtlepatterns.com](http://subtlepatterns.com). The layout is responsive down to 320px and has been optimized for small (phone), medium (tablet) and large (desktop/laptop) devices.

Furthermore, the color scheme can be changed by changing the `@emph` value.
